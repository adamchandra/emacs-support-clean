music practice notes

* music theory

*** Fanatics guide progress
    - "Pivot" on single note:
      - Sing tonic C against CMaj, then against each of 12 Maj keys
      - Sing CMaj 3rd E against all keys, 

*** Fanatics guide progress
    
*** One note series (eventually 2-note and beyond)
    - listen and identify note names (C, C#, D, etc)
      + 10 min on [06/19/12] @ 5:01PM
      + 3 min on  [06/20/12] @ 11:02AM
      + ... sporadic listening over several weeks ...

    - listen and identify solfege
      + same as one-note, but use solfege instead of note names

    - Alternate key one-note
      + same as one-note, but pick a key and name the note accordingly
        + this should eventually use the actual key, rather than pretending
          that C is another key
          
    - N-back singing
      + Listen and identify single notes, then immediately sing 
        the last (or nth last) identified note


*** One note series, alternate modes
    - repeat one-note series, but w/ introductory chords taken from each of 12 modes
    

*** circle of 5ths
    - Mental image of circle
    - Given any key center, construct the rest of the circle with the given key at 12:00
        
*** relative M/m/d/A chords

*** diatonic pathways
      Learn to sing the shortest pathway from a given note to a key center
      - Establish a key center and mode with some chord progression
      - play some note in the given mode
      - after some pause, play the pathway 'home'
     

*** pivoting on a note, pathways style
      + pick a note, then treat it first as do, hear its role, then treat it as re, sing its
        pathway, hear its role, etc...


*** pivoting on a note, scale-style
      1. pick a note, then sing the diatonic major scale w/note as do
      2. starting with the same note, treat it as 're' and sing the mode
      3. continue, using same note as mi, fa, etc.
