Simple, hacky scripts to process a set of ps/pdf files.

Given a set of input files to process, generates a set of gridengine scripts that will each process a 
subset of the files.

Processing includes:
  pstotext
  rexa1 metatagger


TODO:

The script generation itself could be parallelized and run on the grid.

* Script submission should subsequently move or delete the submitted script so as not to resubmit it.
  right now it just renames the *.sh files to *.sh.done, so they won't be resubmitted (this may be enough)

* Scripts should be fully restartable
  * don't
  

Generated log files should also be placed into hierarchical subdirectories to avoid overflowing the
root directory.
