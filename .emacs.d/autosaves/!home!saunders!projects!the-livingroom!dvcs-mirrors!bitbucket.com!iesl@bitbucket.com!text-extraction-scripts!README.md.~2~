Simple, hacky scripts to process a set of ps/pdf files.
=====================

Given a set of input files to process, generates a set of gridengine scripts that will each process a 
subset of the files.

Processing includes:
  pstotext
  rexa1 metatagger


TODO:
--------------

* The script generation itself could be parallelized and run on the grid.


* Script submission should subsequently move or delete the submitted script so as not to resubmit it.
  right now it just renames the *.sh files to *.sh.done, so they won't be resubmitted (this may be enough)


* Scripts should be fully restartable
  * find and process files that were missed during last run
  * don't overwrite the log files generated from previous runs

  
* Utilize parallel directory structures on more than one physical volume to decrease overall IO on any single volume


* 'Nice' scripts so that others can preempt jobs and not get squeezed out
