* rexa-2 ideas

Data
* Include all BibTeX fields in a paper entity, so we can provide a BibTeX entry;  include abstract when available
* Include many more data sources: Annals of Statistics, ArXiv, PubMed,
* Build system that given a paper entity will seek the PDF
* Build system that given a paper entity will seek the abstract (through the PDF or otherwise)

Efficiency
* Parallel coref, scale to 100x more data.

Search
* Better search for author names
* Better search for papers

Front-end, formatting and info:
* Never give out an entity-id in the URL; only mention ids
* On author page, name of the author should not be a link (and therefore in black)
* Lift-enabled on-the-fly updating from DB inference
* Possible to have a list of authors on righthand side of page?  Slow?  Filled in dynamically later?
* Possible to have list of venues across top of page under author name?

Human editing:
* Get human editing really working
* Refine UI

Further extraction and inference
* Infer who is a undergrad, grad student, postdoc, faculty, industry.
* Infer institutional affiliation over time



Feature brainstorms:

Bibliography cleaning service.  User uploads a (possibly noisy and incomplete) BibTeX file; we coref all the mentions and return a canonicalized version.  (Note as a side effect we get a lot of incoming "human edit" mentions, because the user may have done some editing of the BibTeX file locally).  In fact: using BibMogrify we might take the inputs, and provide the outputs, in any number of formats.

Homepage bibliography service.  Provide JavaScript widgets to allow creation of webpages hosted elsewhere (e.g., on researchers' home pages, or course syllabi, etc.) to show canonicalized, formatted citations pulled live from Rexa2, whether based on paper IDs, only author names, or on coref from noisy mentions (e.g. preexisting on the researcher's manually-updated html page).
