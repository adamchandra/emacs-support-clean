exclude    - specifies an exclude pattern.
include    + specifies an include pattern.
merge      . specifies a merge-file to read for more rules.
dir-merge  : specifies a per-directory merge-file.
hide       H specifies a pattern for hiding files from the transfer.
show       S files that match the pattern are not hidden.
protect    P specifies a pattern for protecting files from deletion.
risk       R files that match the pattern are not protected.
clear      ! clears the current include/exclude list (takes no arg)

Modifier for :, . merge rules
   - specifies that the file should consist of only exclude patterns, with no other rule-parsing
     except for in-file comments.
 
   + specifies that the file should consist of only include patterns, with no other rule-parsing
     except for in-file comments.
 
   C is a way to specify that the file should be read in a CVS-compatible manner. This turns on 'n',
     'w', and '-', but also allows the list-clearing token (!) to be specified. If no filename is
     provided, ".cvsignore" is assumed.
 
   e will exclude the merge-file name from the transfer; e.g. "dir-merge,e .rules" is like
     "dir-merge .rules" and "- .rules".
 
   n specifies that the rules are not inherited by subdirectories.
 
   w specifies that the rules are word-split on whitespace instead of the normal
     line-splitting. This also turns off comments. Note: the space that separates the prefix from the
     rule is treated specially, so "- foo + bar" is parsed as two rules (assuming that prefix-parsing
     wasn't also disabled).

You may also specify any of the modifiers for the "+" or "-" rules (above) in order to have the
rules that are read in from the file default to having that modifier set. For instance, "merge,-/
.excl" would treat the contents of .excl as absolute-path excludes, while "dir-merge,s .filt" and
":sC" would each make all their per-directory rules apply only on the sending side.
